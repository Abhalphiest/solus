# Solus


An in-browser game written in javascript, using the Pixi.js engine ( https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js )

This game must be run on a server in order to handle cross-origin media. I recommend either this simple Node server (simply change the filepaths in app.js) from the lovely JACooper: https://github.com/JACooper/FileServe or the Brackets text editor, which runs a Node.js server for you.

The game is hosted (although not necessarily up to date with this repo) at https://people.rit.edu/med7068/330/project2/solus.html
