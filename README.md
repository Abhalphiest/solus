# Solus


An in-browser game written in javascript, using the Pixi.js engine ( https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js )

After pulling the project, use npm install pixi.js (with npm [Node Package Manager] installed, of course) in the root directory to get the pixi.js library. It has been excluded from this repo for housekeeping reasons.
